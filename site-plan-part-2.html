      <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

      <h2>
        Coloration
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        Art is a talent that people would like to share and show their creativity. The amount of works people can create are endless. Coloration is a site that will be for those people that want to share their works. Not only that but  
        they can also learn how to draw, color, etc. This can help those who want to draw learn how to draw professionally and encourage people to express themselves. The actions necessary to interact with the site is that people can look up tutorials if 
        they have an account. People can also share and search topics that the person is interested in and organize it to fit their experience, whether it be fan art, portraits of friends, or a commission this will help provide that.  
        The site can help provide ease of access to images that the user has stared/liked so they can look at them again. Also artists can earn small amounts of money depending on the amount of unique viewer that view art that others created.
        The only limit to your art is your imagination. You can create anything that you imagination can create, after all creativity is infinite so get out there and start drawing. 
              </p>
      <p>Images for the Home page</p>
        <img src="fostler_yun1.png" alt="image for homepage">
        <img src="stock2.jpg" alt="image for homepage">

      </ul>
      <h3>[Page 2]</h3>
      <p>
        When people come here to look at art, they will have many options that will help them look for art that may appeal to them. When they use the search bar, they can then use an advanced search option to help them finetune to the preferences the person may prefer,  
        like maybe the most popular art of the week or of all time on a specific topic. They also can organize the image sizes to be bigger or smaller when they search for a topic because some people want to see the details and others want to skim through to see which ones interest them the most.   
        The topics will be vast in the amount there are because people have different interests and ideas. For many who worry about people who may post inappropriate content the user can enable a safe mode that will block out inapropriate content. Down the line, I might update the site to allow people to post songs  
        on the site eventually because music in my view is also art that people can invest a lot of time into.

      <h3>[Page 3]</h3>
      <p>
        Features that will be included in the site will be commissions where you can ask a specific artist to make a picture for you and the artist can make a picture for the person that asks. This can let artists make a little bit of money  
        which will encourage them to do art for fun or for money. The artist for whatever reason can reject to commission art for someone for whatever reason. Another feature is the ability to follow an artist someone may like. They can get notified when the person   
        has created a new piece of art or if they have an announcement to make. These messages can be found in the community tab of a person or artist's account. There are also forums that people can create to talk about specific pieces of art, styles, or help from the community that people can  
        talk or ask about. I will also include a feature which will allow the user to create their own photo albums which can be a collection of pictures they like from other users and organize pictures they found and label them however they please. These may not be the only features that people 
        can interact with because I can think up more down the line as I update the website.
